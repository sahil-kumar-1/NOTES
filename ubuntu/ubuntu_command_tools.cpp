supervisor

        The supervisor command in Linux is used to manage processes that run in the background or as daemons. It is a client/server system that allows you to control and monitor processes on a Linux system. Supervisor can be used to start, stop, and restart processes as well as monitor their status.

        sudo systemctl start supervisord - This command starts the supervisor daemon.

        sudo systemctl stop supervisord - This command stops the supervisor daemon.

        sudo systemctl restart supervisord - This command restarts the supervisor daemon.

        sudo systemctl status supervisord - This command shows the status of the supervisor daemon.

        sudo supervisorctl status - This command shows the status of all the processes managed by supervisor.

        sudo supervisorctl start <process_name> - This command starts a specific process managed by supervisor.

        sudo supervisorctl stop <process_name> - This command stops a specific process managed by supervisor.

        sudo supervisorctl restart <process_name> - This command restarts a specific process managed by supervisor.
